      <p>
        Carved by the Charyn River over millions of years, Charyn Canyon stretches for dozens of kilometres and
        shows dramatic red cliffs, narrow gorges and sculpted rock towers. The most famous part is the "Valley of
        Castles" — a sequence of sandstone formations that glow at sunrise and sunset. Visitors come for short
        hikes, scenic viewpoints, and unique landscape photography.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> about 3-hour drive from Almaty; guided day trips are common.</p>
      <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> late spring and autumn for comfortable temperatures and clear skies.</p>

      <p>
        Burabay National Park, often called Borovoe, is a popular escape with emerald lakes surrounded by pine forests
        and interesting rock islands rising from the water. The area offers gentle hiking trails, boat rides, picnic
        spots and small guesthouses. It is ideal for families, weekend trips and photographers who enjoy reflections
        and tranquil lake views.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> around 3–4 hours by car from Nur-Sultan (Astana) or shorter from local towns; there are seasonal trains and buses.</p>
      <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> late spring to early autumn for boating and clear weather.</p>

      <h2>Kolsai Lakes</h2>
      <img src="images/kolsai.jpeg" alt="Kolsai Lakes" class="card-img">
      <p>
        The Kolsai Lakes are a chain of three alpine lakes high in the Tian Shan mountains. Each lake is set in a
        forested valley with crystal-clear water and dramatic mountain views. The area is excellent for multiday
        hikes, camping and photography — the second lake is a popular overnight spot for hikers, with local guides
        and yurts available in the valley.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> drive from the town of Saty (then hike or use local transport); moderate hiking skills recommended.</p>
      <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> summer and early autumn, when trails are clear and wildflowers bloom.</p>
